A Python quiz application is a fantastic project to create. Here's a basic outline to get you started:


**Description:**
Build a command-line quiz application that asks users multiple-choice questions and provides feedback on their answers.

**Features:**
1. **Question Bank:** Create a collection of questions along with their multiple-choice options and correct answers.
2. **User Interaction:** Display questions to the user, receive their answers, and provide feedback.
3. **Scoring:** Keep track of the user's score based on the number of correct answers.
4. **Quiz Completion:** Notify the user upon completing the quiz and display their final score.
5. **Time Limit (Optional):** Implement a time limit for answering each question.

**Modules/Libraries:**
1. **Data Structures:** Use dictionaries, lists, or classes to store and manage the questions.
2. **User Input Handling:** Take user input for selecting options and validating answers.
3. **Looping:** Utilize loops to iterate through questions and manage the quiz flow.
4. **Scoring Mechanism:** Implement a scoring system to calculate and display the final score.

**Example Flow:**
1. Load questions and options from a file or define them within the program.
2. Display the first question along with multiple-choice options.
3. Prompt the user to select an option.
4. Validate the user's answer and provide feedback (correct/incorrect).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each subsequent question until the quiz is complete.
6. Display the user's final score at the end of the quiz.

**Additional Challenges:**
- Randomize question order for each attempt.
- Implement a time limit for answering each question.
- Add different levels of difficulty or categories for questions.
- Allow users to choose the number of questions they want to answer.
- Create a leaderboard to store high scores.

This project is a great way to practice handling data structures, user input, conditional statements for checking answers, and iterating through collections of questions. Additionally, you can enhance it by adding more complexity or features based on your learning goals and preferences.
